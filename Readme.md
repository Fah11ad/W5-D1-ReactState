#What is state?

The heart of every React component is its “state”, an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, “state” is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

If you’re not familiar with the idea of state machines (what React “state" is modeled after), this all might seem a bit abstract. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. You’ve interacted with state-based systems your entire life — you just haven’t realized it!
## Your Mission

Today the plan is to identify the app components, create the overall structure, then split that structure into individual components. You'll pass films as props to each component and ultimately use iteration to render one component for each film. At the end of this exercise, you will have this app:
